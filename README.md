### Conclusions

1) From the last portion of the homework as well as the top and bottom performing schools, 
    you can see that charter school students performed better overall than the district schools.  
    We would have to do some further studies to see why that is because it is not directly linked
    to spending (see below).
2) It seems as though increasing the budget per student does not lead to increased test scores. The 
    highest test scores where found in schools that spent between $600 and $615 per student. The lowest
    scores came from the schools spending the most per student, >$645.
